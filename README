genpong is a fork of krzysz00's cl-pong, which I wired up to my
genetic programming engine, genlin (see the genlin repo for details).
The basic idea: a population of pseudo-assembly programmes gradually
adapts to the game of pong. This is pretty close to what I did a
couple of years ago with neuropong, but with linear genetic
programming instead of evolving neural nets, and with common lisp
instead of python.

ORIGINAL README:

cl-pong is a Pong (tm) clone written in Common Lisp. There's no AI
yet, and the only dependency is lispbuilder-sdl. This is a bit of a
private bit of summer hacking, but feel free to take and do as you
will (it's 3-clause BSD licensed).
